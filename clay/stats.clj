;; ## Statistical Functions

;; The `fastmath.stats` namespace provides a comprehensive set of statistical functions for data analysis. This tutorial will cover the main components, demonstrate real-world applications, and explore the API functions. It includes descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, bootstrap methods, time series analysis, and more specialized statistical techniques.

;; Statistical analysis is crucial for making sense of data. It helps identify patterns, relationships, and trends that may not be immediately apparent. The functions in this namespace implement many common [statistical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_method) and follow standard mathematical formulations for accuracy and comparability with other statistical software.

;; First, let's require the necessary namespaces:

(require '[fastmath.stats :as stats]
         '[fastmath.core :as m]
         '[fastmath.random :as r]
         '[clojure.string :as str]
         '[clojure.java.io :as io])

;; ### Loading Real-World Datasets

;; For this tutorial, we'll load datasets from multiple sources to demonstrate real-world statistical analysis. Each dataset has different characteristics, allowing us to showcase various statistical techniques. We'll use:
;; 
;; 1. **[Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)**: A famous multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with four measurements for each flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in centimeters). This dataset is frequently used for classification tasks and demonstrating statistical methods due to its well-formed cluster structure.
;; 
;; 2. **[Motor Trend Car Road Tests (mtcars)](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars)**: Extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, this dataset includes fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). Variables include miles per gallon (mpg), number of cylinders, horsepower, and transmission type.
;; 
;; 3. **[Rock Dataset](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/rock)**: Contains measurements of 48 rock samples from a petroleum reservoir. The variables include permeability, shape, and area measurements, providing data for studying the physical properties of rocks and their relationships.
;; 
;; 4. **[Diamonds Dataset](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html)**: A dataset containing prices and attributes of approximately 54,000 diamonds (we'll use a sample). The variables include price, carat (weight), cut quality, color, clarity, and dimensions (x, y, z). This dataset is excellent for exploring price prediction and understanding how different factors affect diamond valuation.

;; #### CSV Processing Functions

;; First, let's add the [Charred library](https://github.com/cnuernber/charred) dependency for proper CSV parsing.
;; Charred provides high-performance CSV parsing with correct handling of quoted fields, escaped characters, 
;; and other CSV formatting nuances according to [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) standards.
(require '[charred.api :as csv])

(defn parse-number 
  "Parse a string to a number, if possible.
   This function converts numeric strings to Double values while leaving non-numeric strings unchanged.
   It uses a regular expression to identify valid numeric formats (integers and decimals)."
  [s]
  (if (re-matches #"^-?\d+(\.\d+)?$" s)
    (Double/parseDouble s)
    s))

(defn process-csv-data 
  "Process CSV data with header into maps using Charred for proper CSV parsing.
   
   This function:
   1. Parses CSV content using the Charred library
   2. Extracts the header row and converts each field to a keyword

         rows)))

(defn load-csv-from-url
  "Load CSV data from a URL as a string (to be parsed with Charred).
   
   This function:
   1. Opens a connection to the specified URL
   2. Sets a User-Agent header to prevent blocking by some servers
   3. Retrieves and returns the raw content as a string
   
   The returned string can be processed with `process-csv-data`."

;; ### Comprehensive Descriptive Statistics

;; #### Basic Summary Statistics

;; Let's start by exploring some key statistics from the Iris dataset.
;; We'll examine sepal length to understand these fundamental measures:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Count - Number of observations
 (count sepal-length)

 ;; Sum - Total of all values
 (stats/sum sepal-length)
 
 ;; Minimum - Smallest value
 (stats/minimum sepal-length)
 
 ;; Maximum - Largest value
 (stats/maximum sepal-length)
 
 ;; Range - Difference between max and min
 (- (stats/maximum sepal-length) (stats/minimum sepal-length)))

;; The [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_maximum_and_minimum) and [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_maximum_and_minimum) values define the range of the data, which is useful for understanding the spread.

;; #### Central Tendency Measures

;; Central tendency measures help identify the "typical" value in a dataset:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Mean - arithmetic average
 (stats/mean sepal-length)
 
 ;; Median - middle value when sorted
 (stats/median sepal-length)
 
 ;; Mode - most frequent value(s)
 (stats/mode sepal-length)
 
 ;; Modes - all most frequent values
 (stats/modes sepal-length))

;; The [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) is the average value but can be influenced by outliers. The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) is more robust to outliers. The [mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) identifies the most common value(s).

;; There are also different types of means for special cases:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Geometric mean - for data representing multiplicative processes
 ;; Note: All values must be positive
 (stats/geomean (map (partial max 0.1) petal-width))
 
 ;; Harmonic mean - often used for rates and ratios
 (stats/harmean (map (partial max 0.1) petal-width))
 
 ;; Power mean with various powers
 (stats/powmean petal-width 2)  ;; Quadratic mean (or root-mean-square)
 (stats/powmean petal-width 0)  ;; Geometric mean
 (stats/powmean petal-width -1)) ;; Harmonic mean

;; The [geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) is the nth root of the product of n values, useful for growth rates. The [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals, useful for averaging rates.

;; #### Weighted Statistics

;; Sometimes observations have different importance or frequency. 
;; Weighted statistics account for these differences:

;; Let's create a weighted dataset to demonstrate
(def weights [5 2 1 3 4 1 3 2 5 4])
(def values [10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55])

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Weighted mean
 (stats/mean values weights)
 
 ;; Standard mean (for comparison)
 (stats/mean values)
 
 ;; Weighted median
 (stats/wmedian values weights)
 
 ;; Weighted quantiles (25%, 50%, 75%)
 (stats/wquantiles values weights [0.25 0.5 0.75])
 
 ;; Weighted variance
 (stats/wvariance values weights))

;; Weighted statistics are useful when some data points should have more influence than others, such as when working with measurements of different reliability or importance.

;; #### Dispersion and Variability Measures

;; Dispersion measures quantify how spread out the data is:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Variance - average squared deviation from the mean
 (stats/variance sepal-length)
 
 ;; Standard deviation - square root of variance
 (stats/stddev sepal-length)
 
 ;; Population variance and standard deviation 
 ;; (when data represents the entire population rather than a sample)
 (stats/population-variance sepal-length)
 (stats/population-stddev sepal-length)
 
 ;; Coefficient of variation - standardized measure of dispersion
 (stats/variation sepal-length)
 
 ;; Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) - robust measure of variability
 (stats/median-absolute-deviation sepal-length)
 
 ;; Mean Absolute Deviation - another measure of variability
 (stats/mean-absolute-deviation sepal-length)
 
 ;; Interquartile Range (IQR) - difference between 75th and 25th percentiles
 (stats/iqr sepal-length))

;; [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) and [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) quantify the average deviation from the mean. [Median Absolute Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation) (MAD) is more robust to outliers. The [Interquartile Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) covers the middle 50% of the data.

;; #### Shape Measures

;; Shape measures describe the distribution's form:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Skewness - asymmetry of the distribution
 (stats/skewness sepal-length)
 (stats/skewness sepal-length :g1)  ;; Pearson's moment coefficient of skewness
 (stats/skewness sepal-length :b1)  ;; Adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient
 
 ;; Kurtosis - "tailedness" of the distribution
 (stats/kurtosis sepal-length)
 (stats/kurtosis sepal-length :g2)  ;; Excess kurtosis
 (stats/kurtosis sepal-length :moors)) ;; Moors' kurtosis (robust measure)

;; [Skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) measures asymmetry. Positive skewness indicates a right tail (higher values stretch out), while negative skewness indicates a left tail. A normal distribution has a skewness of 0.

;; [Kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) measures the "heaviness" of the tails. Higher kurtosis indicates more outliers. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3 (or excess kurtosis of 0).

;; #### Percentiles and Quantiles

;; Percentiles and quantiles show the distribution by dividing data into equal parts:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Single percentile - value below which X% of observations fall
 (stats/percentile sepal-length 25)  ;; 25th percentile (Q1)
 
 ;; Multiple percentiles
 (stats/percentiles sepal-length [25 50 75 90 95 99])
 
 ;; Quantiles - same as percentiles but in range [0,1]
 (stats/quantile sepal-length 0.25)  ;; 0.25 quantile (Q1)
 (stats/quantile sepal-length 0.5)   ;; 0.5 quantile (median)
 
 ;; Multiple quantiles
 (stats/quantiles sepal-length [0.25 0.5 0.75 0.9 0.95 0.99])
 
 ;; Different estimation strategies affect how quantiles are calculated
 ;; This matters most when there aren't exact data points at the quantile
 (stats/quantile sepal-length 0.5 :legacy)
 (stats/quantile sepal-length 0.5 :r7))  ;; R-7 method (commonly used in R)

;; [Percentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) and [quantiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile) divide the data into equal portions. They help understand the distribution without assuming a specific shape.

;; #### Extents and Ranges

;; Extents provide ranges around central values:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Standard deviation extent (mean Â± stddev) - contains ~68% of data if normal
 (stats/stddev-extent sepal-length)
 
 ;; MAD extent (median Â± MAD) - robust alternative to stddev extent
 (stats/mad-extent sepal-length)
 
 ;; Standard error of mean extent - useful for confidence intervals
 (stats/sem-extent sepal-length)
 
 ;; Percentile extent - based on percentiles (default: 25%, 75%, and median)
 (stats/percentile-extent sepal-length)
 
 ;; Inner fence extent - based on IQR, used for outlier detection
 (stats/inner-fence-extent sepal-length)
 
 ;; Adjacent values - non-outlier extremes
 (stats/adjacent-values sepal-length))

;; Extents provide a quick way to understand the typical range of values in a dataset. Inner fences are used in box plots to identify potential outliers.

;; #### Complete Statistical Summary

;; The `stats-map` function provides a comprehensive statistical summary:

(def summary (stats/stats-map sepal-length))

;; Let's look at some key parts of the summary
(select-keys summary [:Mean :Median :Mode :SD :Skewness :Kurtosis :IQR])

;; The full summary includes over 20 different statistics, making it a powerful way to understand your data at a glance:
summary

;; ### Data Transformation and Preprocessing

;; #### Standardization and Normalization

;; Standardization and normalization are essential for many machine learning algorithms:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Standardize - transform to mean=0, stddev=1 (z-scores)
 (take 5 (stats/standardize sepal-length))
 
 ;; Robust standardization - using median and MAD instead of mean and stddev
 (take 5 (stats/robust-standardize sepal-length))
 
 ;; Rescale to a specific range (default: [0,1])
 (take 5 (stats/rescale sepal-length))
 
 ;; Rescale to [-1,1] range
 (take 5 (stats/rescale sepal-length -1 1)))

;; [Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) makes data comparable across features with different scales. [Rescaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) is useful for algorithms that expect inputs in a specific range.

;; #### Data Cleaning and Processing

;; Functions for preparing data for analysis:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Remove the mean
 (take 5 (stats/demean sepal-length))
 
 ;; Trim outliers (default: remove values outside middle 60%)
 (stats/trim sepal-length)
 
 ;; Winsorize data (replace outliers with boundary values)
 (stats/winsor sepal-length)
 
 ;; Find outliers
 (stats/outliers (concat sepal-length [10 10.5])) ;; add outliers for demonstration
 
 ;; Remove outliers
 (count (stats/remove-outliers (concat sepal-length [10 10.5]))))

;; [Trimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimmed_estimator) and [winsorizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorizing) help deal with outliers. The former removes them, while the latter replaces them with boundary values.

;; #### Statistical Transformations

;; Transformations can make non-normal data more normal and stabilize variance:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Power transformation (Box-Cox transformation)
 ;; Lambda parameter controls the transformation
 ;; Lambda = 0 is log transform, Lambda = 1 is no transformation
 ;; Note: Data must be positive
 (take 5 (stats/power-transformation petal-width 0.5))  ;; Square root-like transformation
 
 ;; Modified power transformation - allows negative values
 (take 5 (stats/modified-power-transformation petal-width 0.5))
 
 ;; Yeo-Johnson transformation - an alternative that handles negative values
 (take 5 (stats/yeo-johnson-transformation petal-length 0.5)))

;; [Power transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform) like Box-Cox help normalize skewed data. [Yeo-Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform#Yeo%E2%80%93Johnson_transformation) is a generalization that handles negative values.

;; ### Correlation and Covariance

;; #### Understanding Relationships Between Variables

;; Correlation and covariance measure relationships between variables:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Covariance - measures how two variables change together
 (stats/covariance sepal-length petal-length)
 
 ;; Pearson correlation - measures linear correlation
 (stats/pearson-correlation sepal-length petal-length)
 (stats/correlation sepal-length petal-length) ;; Same as Pearson
 
 ;; Spearman rank correlation - measures monotonic relationships
 (stats/spearman-correlation sepal-length petal-length)
 
 ;; Kendall rank correlation - another rank-based measure
 (stats/kendall-correlation sepal-length petal-length))

;; [Pearson correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) measures linear relationships, while [Spearman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) and [Kendall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient) measure rank-based relationships, making them more robust to outliers and non-linear patterns.

;; #### Correlation and Covariance Matrices

;; For multivariate data, we can compute full correlation and covariance matrices:

;; Let's use the iris measurements data
(def iris-measurements-transposed (apply map vector iris-measurements))

;; Correlation matrix shows correlations between all pairs of variables
(stats/correlation-matrix iris-measurements-transposed)

;; Covariance matrix shows covariances between all pairs of variables
(stats/covariance-matrix iris-measurements-transposed)

;; We can specify which correlation method to use
(stats/correlation-matrix iris-measurements-transposed :spearman)

;; [Correlation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Correlation_matrices) show all pairwise correlations at once, useful for multivariate analysis. [Covariance matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix) are fundamental in many statistical methods, including principal component analysis.

;; ### Regression Error Metrics

;; #### Evaluating Prediction Accuracy

;; These metrics quantify the error between predicted and actual values:

;; Let's create some predicted values for demonstration
(def actual mpg)
(def predicted (map #(+ % (- (rand 3) 1.5)) actual))  ;; actual with some noise

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Mean Error - average of errors (can have cancellation)
 (stats/me [actual predicted])
 
 ;; Mean Absolute Error - average of absolute errors
 (stats/mae [actual predicted])
 
 ;; Mean Absolute Percentage Error - percentage errors
 (stats/mape [actual predicted])
 
 ;; Residual Sum of Squares - sum of squared errors
 (stats/rss [actual predicted])
 
 ;; R-squared - coefficient of determination
 (stats/r2 [actual predicted])
 
 ;; Mean Squared Error - average of squared errors
 (stats/mse [actual predicted])
 
 ;; Root Mean Squared Error - square root of MSE
 (stats/rmse [actual predicted]))

;; These metrics help evaluate the performance of regression models. [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) penalizes large errors more than MAE. [RÂ²](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) indicates the proportion of variance explained.

;; #### Distance Metrics

;; Distance metrics quantify the difference between vectors:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; L0 - count of different elements
 (stats/L0 [1 2 3 4] [1 2 4 4])
 
 ;; L1 - Manhattan distance (sum of absolute differences)
 (stats/L1 [1 2 3 4] [2 3 4 5])
 
 ;; L2 - Euclidean distance (square root of sum of squared differences)
 (stats/L2 [1 2 3 4] [2 3 4 5])
 
 ;; L2 squared - Sum of squared differences
 (stats/L2sq [1 2 3 4] [2 3 4 5])
 
 ;; L-infinity - Maximum absolute difference
 (stats/LInf [1 2 3 4] [2 3 4 8])
 
 ;; Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - used in image quality assessment
 (stats/psnr [1 2 3 4] [2 3 4 5]))

;; [Distance metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)) quantify the difference between vectors in different ways. Each has specific properties making it suitable for different applications.

;; ### Histograms and Distributions

;; #### Creating and Analyzing Histograms

;; Histograms divide data into bins to show the distribution:

;; Create a histogram of sepal lengths
(def sepal-length-hist (stats/histogram sepal-length))

;; Basic information about the histogram
(select-keys sepal-length-hist [:size :min :max :step :samples])

;; Bin information - range and count for each bin
(:bins sepal-length-hist)

;; We can control the number of bins or the binning method
(def sepal-length-hist-10bins (stats/histogram sepal-length 10))
(:bins sepal-length-hist-10bins)

(def sepal-length-hist-sturges (stats/histogram sepal-length :sturges))
(:bins sepal-length-hist-sturges)

;; Different bin estimation methods for histograms
(stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :sqrt)      ;; Square root rule
(stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :sturges)   ;; Sturges' formula
(stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :rice)      ;; Rice rule
(stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :doane)     ;; Doane's formula
(stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :scott)     ;; Scott's normal reference rule

;; [Histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) visualize data distribution by counting values in each bin. The choice of bin count affects how the distribution appears.

;; #### Comparing Distributions

;; There are several ways to compare distributions:

;; Calculate the similarity between two distributions
(def dist1 petal-length)
(def dist2 petal-width)

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Dissimilarity metrics
 ;; Kullback-Leibler divergence
 (stats/dissimilarity :kullback-leibler dist1 dist2)
 
 ;; Jensen-Shannon divergence
 (stats/dissimilarity :jensen-shannon dist1 dist2)
 
 ;; Hellinger distance
 (stats/dissimilarity :hellinger dist1 dist2)
 
 ;; Euclidean-based distance
 (stats/dissimilarity :euclidean dist1 dist2)
 
 ;; Similarity metrics (higher means more similar)
 ;; Intersection similarity
 (stats/similarity :intersection dist1 dist2)
 
 ;; Cosine similarity
 (stats/similarity :cosine dist1 dist2))

;; [Distribution comparisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance) are useful in many domains, including machine learning, information retrieval, and statistical testing.

;; ### Bootstrap Methods

;; #### Resampling for Robust Statistics

;; Bootstrapping creates resamples from data to estimate statistics and their uncertainty:

;; Generate bootstrap resamples of sepal length
(def bootstrap-samples

;; #### Advanced Bootstrap Examples with Real-World Data

;; Let's apply bootstrapping to our public datasets to solve practical problems.

;; ##### Example 1: Confidence Interval for Diamond Price/Carat Ratio

;; The price-per-carat ratio is an important metric in diamond valuation.
;; Let's use bootstrapping to estimate the confidence interval for the mean price/carat.

;; Calculate price per carat for each diamond
(def price-per-carat (map #(/ %1 %2) diamond-price diamond-carat))

;; Direct calculation of the mean
(stats/mean price-per-carat)

;; Bootstrap to estimate confidence interval for the mean price/carat
(def ppc-bootstrap-samples
  (repeatedly 100
              #(stats/mean (r/->seq (r/distribution :enumerated-real
                                                    {:data price-per-carat})
                                    (count price-per-carat)))))

;; Calculate 95% confidence interval
(stats/percentile-extent ppc-bootstrap-samples 2.5)

;; ##### Example 2: Robust Correlation Estimation for Rock Properties

;; We can use bootstrapping to get a more robust estimate of the correlation
;; between rock area and permeability, along with confidence intervals.

;; Function to calculate correlation from resampled data
(defn bootstrap-correlation [xs ys]
  (let [n (count xs)
        indices (repeatedly n #(r/irand n))
        x-sample (map #(nth xs %) indices)
        y-sample (map #(nth ys %) indices)]
    (stats/correlation x-sample y-sample)))

;; Generate bootstrap samples of correlation
(def area-perm-corr-samples
  (repeatedly 100 #(bootstrap-correlation rock-area rock-perm)))

;; Calculate the mean and confidence interval
(stats/mean area-perm-corr-samples)
(stats/percentile-extent area-perm-corr-samples 2.5)

;; ##### Example 3: Comparing Medians with Bootstrapped Hypothesis Testing

;; We'll compare the median MPG of automatic vs manual transmission cars
;; using a bootstrapped hypothesis test approach.

;; Calculate the observed difference in medians
(def observed-diff (- (stats/median manual-trans-mpg) (stats/median auto-trans-mpg)))

;; Function to simulate under the null hypothesis (no difference)
(defn simulate-null-hypothesis [xs ys]
  (let [pooled (concat xs ys)
        n1 (count xs)
        n2 (count ys)
        shuffled (shuffle pooled)
        sim-xs (take n1 shuffled)
        sim-ys (drop n1 shuffled)]
    (- (stats/median sim-ys) (stats/median sim-xs))))


;; Generate distribution under null hypothesis
(def null-distribution
  (repeatedly 100 #(simulate-null-hypothesis auto-trans-mpg manual-trans-mpg)))

;; Calculate the p-value (two-tailed test)
(def p-value
  (/ (count (filter #(>= (m/abs %) (m/abs observed-diff)) null-distribution))
     100))

;; Print results

;; [Bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) is a powerful technique for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic, especially when the underlying distribution is unknown or complex. It allows us to make robust inferences without relying on distributional assumptions.

;; ### Hypothesis Testing

;; #### Statistical Tests

;; Hypothesis tests determine if observed data supports a statistical hypothesis:

;; t-tests for comparing means
(utls/examples-note
 ;; One-sample t-test - compare a sample mean to a hypothesized value
 (stats/t-test-one-sample sepal-length {:mu 5.5})
 
 ;; Two-sample t-test - compare means of two samples
 (stats/t-test-two-samples 
  (map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data))
 
 ;; Paired t-test - compare matched pairs
 (stats/t-test-two-samples 
  (map first setosa-data) 
  (map second setosa-data) 
  {:paired? true}))

;; z-tests (for when population standard deviation is known)
(utls/examples-note
 ;; One-sample z-test
 (stats/z-test-one-sample sepal-length {:mu 5.8})
 
 ;; Two-sample z-test
 (stats/z-test-two-samples
  (map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data)))

;; F-test for comparing variances
(stats/f-test (map first setosa-data)
             (map first versicolor-data))

;; ANOVA for comparing multiple groups
(stats/one-way-anova-test 
 [(map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data)
  (map first virginica-data)])

;; Normality tests
(utls/examples-note
 ;; Test based on skewness and kurtosis
 (stats/normality-test sepal-length)
 
 ;; Jarque-Bera test
 (stats/jarque-bera-test sepal-length))

;; Binomial test (for binary data)
(stats/binomial-test [true false true true false true true])

;; [Hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) is foundational in statistical inference. The p-value from these tests indicates the probability of observing the data (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true.

;; #### Effect Size Measures

;; Effect size quantifies the magnitude of an effect or relationship:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Cohen's d - standardized mean difference
 (stats/cohens-d 
  (map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data))
 
 ;; Hedges' g - less biased alternative to Cohen's d
 (stats/hedges-g
  (map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data))
 
 ;; Glass's delta - uses only the control group's standard deviation
 (stats/glass-delta
  (map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data))
 
 ;; Cliff's delta - for ordinal data
 (stats/cliffs-delta
  (map first setosa-data)
  (map first versicolor-data)))

;; Effect sizes for correlations and regression
(utls/examples-note
 ;; R-squared - proportion of variance explained
 (stats/r2-determination [sepal-length petal-length])
 
 ;; Cohen's f-squared - for multiple regression
 (stats/cohens-f2 [sepal-length petal-length])
 
 ;; Cohen's q - comparison of correlations
 (stats/cohens-q
  (stats/correlation sepal-length petal-length)
  (stats/correlation sepal-width petal-width)))

;; [Effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) measures complement p-values by quantifying the magnitude of effects, which is often more informative than statistical significance alone.

;; ### Time Series Analysis

;; #### Autocorrelation Analysis

;; Autocorrelation measures correlation between a time series and its lags:

;; Create a simple time series with a pattern
(def time-series (concat (repeat 10 1) (repeat 10 2) (repeat 10 1) (repeat 10 2)))

;; Calculate autocorrelation function (ACF)
(stats/acf time-series 10)

;; Get ACF with confidence intervals
(stats/acf-ci time-series 10)

;; Calculate partial autocorrelation function (PACF)
(stats/pacf time-series 10)

;; Get PACF with confidence intervals
(stats/pacf-ci time-series 10)

;; Calculate Durbin-Watson statistic (test for autocorrelation in residuals)
(stats/durbin-watson time-series)

;; [Autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) and [partial autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_autocorrelation_function) help identify patterns in time series data, which is crucial for forecasting and model selection.

;; ### Binary Classification Metrics

;; #### Evaluating Classification Performance

;; These metrics assess the performance of binary classification models:

;; Create a confusion matrix from actual and predicted classes
(def confusion-matrix 
  (stats/->confusion-matrix 
   [true true false true false false true true]  ;; actual
   [true false false true false true true false])) ;; predicted

;; Calculate classification metrics
(def metrics (stats/binary-measures-all confusion-matrix))

;; Key performance metrics
(select-keys metrics [:accuracy :precision :recall :f1-score])

;; The full set of metrics
metrics

;; Alternatively, specify true positives, false negatives, etc. directly
(stats/binary-measures 3 2 1 2)

;; Contingency table measures
(stats/contingency-2x2-measures 3 2 1 2)

;; [Classification metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) provide a comprehensive evaluation of a classifier's performance, emphasizing different aspects (precision, recall, etc.).

;; ### Statistical Distributions

;; The power-divergence test and its variants help analyze contingency tables and compare distributions:

;; Create a contingency table
(def cont-table {[0 0] 30 [0 1] 10 [1 0] 15 [1 1] 25})

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Power-divergence test
 (stats/power-divergence-test cont-table)
 
 ;; Chi-squared test
 (stats/chisq-test cont-table)
 
 ;; Multinomial likelihood ratio test (G-test)
 (stats/multinomial-likelihood-ratio-test cont-table)
 
 ;; Cressie-Read test
 (stats/cressie-read-test cont-table))

;; KS and AD tests compare samples to distributions
(utls/examples-note
 ;; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test - one sample vs distribution
 (stats/ks-test-one-sample sepal-length r/default-normal)
 
 ;; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test - two samples
 (stats/ks-test-two-samples (map first setosa-data) (map first versicolor-data))
 
 ;; Anderson-Darling test
 (stats/ad-test-one-sample sepal-length r/default-normal))

;; [Goodness-of-fit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit) like chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov determine if data follows a particular distribution or if two samples come from the same distribution.

;; ### Advanced Statistics

;; #### Pooled Statistics

;; Pooled statistics combine data from multiple groups:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Pooled variance
 (stats/pooled-variance 
  [(map first setosa-data) 
   (map first versicolor-data)])
 
 ;; Pooled standard deviation
 (stats/pooled-stddev
  [(map first setosa-data) 
   (map first versicolor-data)]))

;; [Pooled variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooled_variance) combines variances from multiple groups, assuming equal variances, useful in t-tests and ANOVA.

;; #### Confidence Intervals

;; Confidence intervals quantify the uncertainty in estimates:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; t-distribution based CI for mean
 (stats/ci sepal-length)
 
 ;; Binomial proportion confidence interval
 (stats/binomial-ci 40 100)
 
 ;; Different methods for binomial CIs
 (stats/binomial-ci 40 100 :wilson)
 (stats/binomial-ci 40 100 :clopper-pearson)
 (stats/binomial-ci 40 100 :agresti-coull))

;; [Confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) provide a range of plausible values for a parameter, along with a confidence level (typically 95%).

;; ### Putting It All Together: Real-World Examples

;; #### Example 1: Car Performance Analysis

;; Let's analyze the relationship between car weight and miles per gallon from the mtcars dataset:

;; First, let's look at the summary statistics
(stats/stats-map mpg)
(stats/stats-map wt)

;; Calculate the correlation between weight and mpg
(stats/correlation wt mpg)

;; Test if the correlation is statistically significant
;; We can do this by examining the coefficient of determination (r-squared)
(stats/r2-determination [wt mpg])

;; Is there a significant difference in MPG between cars with automatic vs manual transmission?
;; We defined auto-trans-mpg and manual-trans-mpg earlier

;; Run a t-test to compare the means
(stats/t-test-two-samples auto-trans-mpg manual-trans-mpg)

;; Calculate the effect size (Cohen's d)
(stats/cohens-d auto-trans-mpg manual-trans-mpg)

;; Visualize the distribution with a histogram
(def mpg-hist (stats/histogram mpg))
(:bins mpg-hist)

;; Check if MPG follows a normal distribution
(stats/normality-test mpg)

;; #### Example 2: Rock Properties Analysis

;; Now, let's analyze the rock dataset we loaded from a public URL.
;; This dataset contains measurements of 48 rock samples from a petroleum reservoir.

;; First, let's get a statistical summary of the rock permeability
(stats/stats-map rock-perm)

;; And look at the rock shape factor
(stats/stats-map rock-shape)

;; Let's examine the relationship between rock shape and permeability
(stats/correlation rock-shape rock-perm)

;; Is there a significant correlation?
(stats/r2-determination [rock-shape rock-perm])

;; We can divide rocks into groups by permeability to compare their characteristics
(def high-perm-rocks (filter #(> (:perm %) 100) rock-data))
(def low-perm-rocks (filter #(<= (:perm %) 100) rock-data))

;; Compare the area of high vs low permeability rocks
(def high-perm-area (map :area high-perm-rocks))
(def low-perm-area (map :area low-perm-rocks))

;; Run a t-test to see if there's a significant difference
(when (and (seq high-perm-area) (seq low-perm-area))
  (stats/t-test-two-samples high-perm-area low-perm-area))

;; Create a histogram of rock permeability
(def perm-hist (stats/histogram rock-perm))
(:bins perm-hist)

;; #### Example 3: Diamond Price Analysis

;; Finally, let's explore the diamonds dataset to understand price determinants.

;; Get summary statistics for diamond prices
(stats/stats-map diamond-price)

;; And for diamond carat (weight)
(stats/stats-map diamond-carat)

;; Examine the correlation between carat and price
(stats/correlation diamond-carat diamond-price)

;; Calculate the RÂ² to understand how much of price variation is explained by carat
(stats/r2-determination [diamond-carat diamond-price])

;; Let's examine how diamond proportions affect price
;; Calculate the volume (approximated as x * y * z) and analyze its relationship with price
(def diamond-volume (map #(* (:x %) (:y %) (:z %)) diamonds-data))

;; Correlation between volume and price
(stats/correlation diamond-volume diamond-price)

;; Let's check if there's a relationship between table percentage and price
(stats/correlation diamond-table diamond-price)

;; Standardize the price and carat to compare their distributions
(def std-price (stats/standardize diamond-price))
(def std-carat (stats/standardize diamond-carat))

;; How similar are these distributions?
(stats/dissimilarity :jensen-shannon std-price std-carat)

;; Create a histogram of diamond prices
(def price-hist (stats/histogram diamond-price))
(:bins price-hist)

;; Test if diamond prices follow a normal distribution
(stats/normality-test diamond-price)

;; #### Example 4: Cross-Dataset Comparison

;; Let's compare the distribution shapes across our different datasets

;; Calculate skewness for different variables across datasets
(utls/examples-note
 ;; Iris petal width skewness
 (stats/skewness petal-width)
 
 ;; Car mpg skewness
 (stats/skewness mpg)
 
 ;; Rock permeability skewness
 (stats/skewness rock-perm)
 
 ;; Diamond price skewness
 (stats/skewness diamond-price))

;; Calculate kurtosis for different variables across datasets
(utls/examples-note
 ;; Iris petal width kurtosis
 (stats/kurtosis petal-width)
 
 ;; Car mpg kurtosis
 (stats/kurtosis mpg)
 
 ;; Rock permeability kurtosis
 (stats/kurtosis rock-perm)
 
 ;; Diamond price kurtosis
 (stats/kurtosis diamond-price))

;; Compare the coefficient of variation across datasets
(utls/examples-note
 ;; Iris petal width variation
 (stats/variation petal-width)
 
 ;; Car mpg variation
 (stats/variation mpg)
 
 ;; Rock permeability variation
 (stats/variation rock-perm)
 
 ;; Diamond price variation
 (stats/variation diamond-price))

;; ### Additional Statistical Techniques

;; #### Compensation Summation Methods

;; When working with floating-point numbers, standard summation can accumulate significant rounding errors.
;; This is because floating-point arithmetic has limited precision, and small values can be "lost" when added
;; to much larger values. For high precision summation, FastMath provides several compensation methods that
;; track and compensate for these rounding errors:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Regular sum - standard summation that can accumulate rounding errors
 ;; Note: Theoretically, 1000 Ã— 0.1 should equal exactly 100
 (stats/sum (repeat 1000 0.1))
 
 ;; [Kahan summation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm) - reduces numerical error
 ;; This algorithm keeps a separate "compensation" term to track lost low-order bits
 (stats/sum (repeat 1000 0.1) :kahan)
 
 ;; [Neumaier algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm#Further_enhancements) - improved Kahan algorithm
 ;; An enhancement to Kahan's algorithm that handles certain edge cases better
 (stats/sum (repeat 1000 0.1) :neumaier)
 
 ;; Klein algorithm - further improved summation with higher precision
 ;; A more sophisticated method that provides even better numerical stability
 (stats/sum (repeat 1000 0.1) :klein))

;; These compensation techniques are particularly important in scientific computing, financial calculations,
;; and statistical analysis where small errors can accumulate and lead to significant inaccuracies.
;; [Floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) has inherent limitations
;; due to how numbers are represented in binary form, and these compensation methods help mitigate those limitations.

;; #### Advanced Statistical Tests for Homogeneity of Variance

;; Many statistical procedures (like ANOVA and certain t-tests) assume that different groups have similar variances, 
;; a property known as [homogeneity of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_of_variance) or homoscedasticity.
;; FastMath includes several tests for checking this assumption across multiple groups:

;; For these tests, let's define three samples with deliberately different dispersions
(def normal1 (repeatedly 50 #(r/grand 100 10))) ;; Normal distribution with SD=10
(def normal2 (repeatedly 50 #(r/grand 100 20))) ;; Normal distribution with SD=20 (twice the variance)
(def skewed (map #(m/sq %) (repeatedly 50 #(r/grand 0 15)))) ;; Chi-squared-like skewed distribution

(utls/examples-note
 ;; [Levene's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levene%27s_test) - tests equality of variances across groups
 ;; This test compares the absolute deviations from the group means
 ;; Less sensitive to departures from normality than earlier tests like Bartlett's test
 ;; Returns p-value (small p-value suggests variances differ significantly)
 (stats/levene-test [normal1 normal2 skewed])
 
 ;; [Brown-Forsythe test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown%E2%80%93Forsythe_test) - modification of Levene's test
 ;; Uses deviations from group medians instead of means, making it more robust to outliers and non-normality
 ;; Better performance for skewed distributions
 (stats/brown-forsythe-test [normal1 normal2 skewed])
 
 ;; [Fligner-Killeen test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fligner%E2%80%93Killeen_test) - non-parametric test for homogeneity of variances
 ;; Based on ranks of absolute deviations from group medians
 ;; Very robust to departures from normality, recommended when data might be non-normal
 (stats/fligner-killeen-test [normal1 normal2 skewed]))

;; These tests return p-values. A small p-value (typically < 0.05) suggests that the variances differ significantly
;; across groups, violating the homogeneity of variance assumption. This can inform your choice of statistical methods:
;; - If the assumption is met, you can proceed with standard ANOVA or t-tests
;; - If violated, consider using Welch's ANOVA, non-parametric tests like Kruskal-Wallis, or transforming your data

;; #### Advanced Contingency Table Analysis

;; [Contingency tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) (also called cross-tabulations or crosstabs)
;; display the frequency distribution of categorical variables. They're essential for analyzing relationships between
;; categorical data, such as survey responses, experimental outcomes, or demographic categories.

;; Create a 3Ã—3 contingency table representing counts of observations with different category combinations
;; For example, this could represent three education levels (rows) and three income brackets (columns)
(def contingency-3x3 {[0 0] 30 [0 1] 10 [0 2] 5    ;; Row 0: 30 in column 0, 10 in column 1, 5 in column 2
                      [1 0] 15 [1 1] 45 [1 2] 10    ;; Row 1: 15 in column 0, 45 in column 1, 10 in column 2
                      [2 0] 5  [2 1] 15 [2 2] 25})  ;; Row 2: 5 in column 0, 15 in column 1, 25 in column 2

;; Extract marginal totals (row and column sums)
;; These totals provide the distribution of each variable independently
(stats/contingency-table->marginals contingency-3x3)

;; Calculate association measures to quantify the relationship strength between variables
(utls/examples-note
 ;; [Cramer's V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%27s_V) - effect size measure for contingency tables
 ;; This is a normalized version of the chi-squared statistic that ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (perfect association)
 ;; Values around: 0.1 = small effect, 0.3 = medium effect, 0.5+ = large effect
 (stats/cramers-v contingency-3x3)
 
 ;; Cramer's V with bias correction for small samples
 ;; This adjustment improves accuracy when sample sizes are small (typically < 1000)
 (stats/cramers-v-corrected contingency-3x3)
 
 ;; [Tschuprow's T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschuprow%27s_T) - alternative to Cramer's V
 ;; Similar to Cramer's V but with a different normalization approach
 ;; Less commonly used but can be more appropriate for tables with unequal dimensions
 (stats/tschuprows-t contingency-3x3)
 
 ;; [Cohen's kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa) - measure of agreement for categorical data
 ;; Particularly useful for measuring inter-rater reliability or agreement between two methods
 ;; Values range from -1 to 1, with: < 0 = poor, 0.01-0.20 = slight, 0.21-0.40 = fair, 0.41-0.60 = moderate,
 ;; 0.61-0.80 = substantial, 0.81-1.00 = almost perfect agreement
 ;; Here demonstrated with a 2Ã—2 contingency table (representing two raters classifying items into two categories)
 (stats/cohens-kappa {[0 0] 40 [0 1] 10  ;; 40 items rated as 0 by both raters, 10 as 0 by rater 1 and 1 by rater 2
                       [1 0] 5 [1 1] 45})) ;; 5 as 1 by rater 1 and 0 by rater 2, 45 as 1 by both raters

;; These association measures quantify the strength and nature of relationships between categorical variables.
;; They help determine if observed patterns are merely random or represent meaningful associations. Different measures
;; are appropriate for different scenarios, depending on the table dimensions and research question.

;; #### Histogram Features and Bin Selection

;; [Histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) visualize the distribution of continuous data by dividing it into
;; discrete bins or intervals and counting how many values fall into each bin. One of the most critical decisions
;; when creating a histogram is choosing an appropriate number of bins. Too few bins can obscure important
;; patterns (undersmoothing), while too many bins can create noise (oversmoothing).

;; FastMath provides several established methods for estimating optimal bin counts:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; Different bin estimation methods applied to the iris sepal length data
 
 ;; [Sturges' formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Sturges'_formula): k = âŒˆlogâ‚‚(n)âŒ‰ + 1
 ;; Based on approximating data with a normal distribution
 (stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :sturges)
 
 ;; [Rice rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Rice_rule): k = âŒˆ2n^(1/3)âŒ‰
 ;; A slightly more conservative variant that typically uses more bins than Sturges'
 (stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :rice)
 
 ;; [Scott's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Scott's_normal_reference_rule): h = 3.49Ïƒn^(-1/3)
 ;; Minimizes integrated mean squared error for normal data
 ;; Returns optimal bin width, which FastMath converts to bin count
 (stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :scott)
 
 ;; [Freedman-Diaconis rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%E2%80%93Diaconis_rule): h = 2Ã—IQRÃ—n^(-1/3)
 ;; Similar to Scott's rule but uses IQR instead of standard deviation, making it more robust to outliers
 (stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :fd)
 
 ;; Square root rule: k = âŒˆâˆšnâŒ‰
 ;; A simple heuristic that is quick to calculate but less statistically grounded
 (stats/estimate-bins sepal-length :sqrt))

;; The choice of binning method can significantly affect how the histogram represents the data:
;; - **[Sturges' rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Sturges'_formula)** works well for normally distributed data with approximately 30-200 observations
;; - **[Scott's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Scott's_normal_reference_rule)** adapts bin width based on the data's standard deviation, optimal for normal distributions
;; - **[Freedman-Diaconis rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%E2%80%93Diaconis_rule)** is more robust against outliers since it uses the interquartile range
;; - **Square root rule** is a simple heuristic rule that uses âˆšn bins for n data points

;; Let's create histograms with different bin strategies and compare their results:
(def hist-sturges (stats/histogram sepal-length :sturges))
(def hist-scott (stats/histogram sepal-length :scott))
(def hist-fd (stats/histogram sepal-length :fd))

;; Compare the bin counts (how many bins each method creates)
(map #(count (:bins %)) [hist-sturges hist-scott hist-fd])

;; The difference in bin counts affects how we perceive the distribution's shape.
;; When reporting histogram results, it's good practice to mention which binning rule you used,
;; as this can influence the visual patterns and conclusions drawn from the data.

;; #### Effect Size Interpretation Guidelines

;; [Effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) measures quantify the magnitude of differences or relationships, 
;; independent of sample size. Unlike p-values, which primarily indicate statistical significance, effect sizes focus on 
;; practical significanceâ€”how substantial the effect is in real-world terms.

;; Most effect size measures have conventional thresholds for interpretation based on extensive research.
;; Here are guidelines for interpreting common effect size measures in FastMath:

(utls/examples-note
 ;; For [Cohen's d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d) and [Hedges' g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Hedges'_g):
 ;; These measure standardized mean differences between two groups
 ;; The thresholds below come from Cohen's original proposals, based on extensive empirical work:
 ;;   < 0.2 = negligible effect (groups are practically identical)
 ;;   ~0.2 = small effect (difference is real but might require careful measurement to detect)
 ;;   ~0.5 = medium effect (difference is noticeable to the naked eye of a careful observer)
 ;;   ~0.8 = large effect (difference is obvious, grossly perceptible)
 ;;   > 1.2 = very large effect (difference is extremely substantial)
 (let [d (stats/cohens-d sepal-length petal-length)]
   {:effect-size d
    :interpretation 
    (cond
      (< (m/abs d) 0.2) "Negligible effect"
      (< (m/abs d) 0.5) "Small effect"
      (< (m/abs d) 0.8) "Medium effect"
      (< (m/abs d) 1.2) "Large effect"
      :else "Very large effect")})
 
 ;; For [correlation coefficients (r)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient):
 ;; These measure the strength of linear relationship between two variables
 ;; Guidelines initially proposed by Cohen and refined through later research:
 ;;   < 0.1 = negligible correlation
 ;;   ~0.1 = small correlation (relationship exists but is difficult to see)
 ;;   ~0.3 = medium correlation (relationship is visible but not dominant)
 ;;   ~0.5 = large correlation (substantial relationship)
 ;;   > 0.7 = very large correlation (relationship dominates the data)

 ;; Cohen's guidelines for f:
 ;;   < 0.1 = negligible effect
 ;;   ~0.1 = small effect (groups differ slightly)
 ;;   ~0.25 = medium effect (moderate group differences)

;; These interpretation guidelines should not be applied rigidly across all fields. Different disciplines may have
;; different norms for what constitutes "large" or "small" effects based on the typical effect sizes observed in that field.
;; For example:
;; - In medical research, even a "small" effect size of d=0.2 might be meaningful if it represents mortality reduction
;; - In psychological research, a correlation of r=0.3 might be considered substantial given the complexity of human behavior
;; - In physics, where measurement precision is often very high, even smaller effects may be considered meaningful

;; When reporting effect sizes, it's good practice to provide both the numerical value and an interpretation based on
;; established guidelines and the specific context of your research domain.

;; #### Specialized Distribution Overlap Measures

;; While traditional effect sizes like Cohen's d are statistically rigorous, they can be difficult to interpret
;; intuitively. FastMath provides several specialized overlap measures that express effect sizes in more 
;; human-understandable terms by quantifying how much two distributions overlap or separate.

;; First, let's create two groups with partial overlap for demonstration:
;; - Group A: normally distributed around mean=100 with SD=15
;; - Group B: normally distributed around mean=130 with SD=20
;; (These could represent test scores for two different teaching methods, for example)
(def group-a (repeatedly 50 #(r/grand 100 15)))
(def group-b (repeatedly 50 #(r/grand 130 20)))

 ;; [Probability of superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test#Common_language_effect_size)
 ;; (also called Common Language Effect Size or CLES)
 ;; Interpretation: The probability that a randomly selected individual from group B will have
 ;; a higher score than a randomly selected individual from group A
 ;; Range: 0 to 1, where 0.5 means no effect (equal chance), values near 1 indicate strong separation
 ;; Example: A value of 0.85 means "In 85% of cases, a random person from group B outscores a random person from group A"
 (stats/wmw-odds group-a group-b)
 
 ;; [Cohen's U3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_U3)
 ;; Interpretation: The percentage of group A that falls below the median of group B
 ;; Range: 0 to 1, where 0.5 means no effect (groups identical), values near 1 indicate strong separation
 ;; Example: A value of 0.90 means "90% of group A falls below the median of group B"
 (stats/cohens-u3 group-a group-b)
 
 ;; [Probability of overlap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_coefficient)
 ;; Interpretation: The percentage of overlap between the two distributions
 ;; Range: 0 to 1, where 1 means complete overlap (identical distributions), values near 0 indicate strong separation
 ;; Example: A value of 0.20 means "The distributions overlap by only 20%"
 (stats/p-overlap group-a group-b))

;; These measures translate abstract statistical concepts into everyday language, making results more accessible
;; to non-statisticians. For example, telling stakeholders that "There's an 85% chance that someone using method B
;; will outperform someone using method A" is more intuitive than reporting "Cohen's d = 1.2".

;; When reporting results, it's often beneficial to include both traditional effect sizes (like Cohen's d) for
;; statistical rigor and these overlap measures for interpretability. Different overlap measures highlight different
;; aspects of the comparison, so choose the ones most relevant to your specific research question.
